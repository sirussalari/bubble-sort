# bubble-sort

This project is an assignment part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This simple program consists of one function that takes a single argument meant to be an array of numbers.

The purpose and function of the program is to use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array that is passed in by the user.

In case you're unaware, the bubble sort algorithm is defined by comparing a number with its successor in the array, and then swap the numbers if the successor is larger. You continue this pattern until the entire array has been sorted from least to greatest.
